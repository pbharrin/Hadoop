This Fork adds the Snappy compression Codec.
In order to use snappy, first you should download the snappy C++ code: 
http://code.google.com/p/snappy/

Next you need to build and install Snappy
> tar xvf snappy-1.0.5.tar.gz
> cd snappy-1.0.5
> ./configure
> sudo make install

Next get the python Snappy library:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-snappy
> tar xvf python-snappy-0.4
> sudo python setup.py install

Now you should be able to use the Hadoop library.
